Create an App using Docker build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this exercise we will learn how to create an application from a
Dockerfile. OpenShift takes Dockerfile as an input and generates your
application docker image for you.

*Step 1: Add a new project from command line*

IMPORTANT: Please replace *userxx* with your username

- login to web UI via https://master.ocp.tauil.org
- Use the same username and password that assigned to you
- Click `Create Project`

image::new-project.png[image]

- Enter `dockerfile-*userxx*` as project name (all lower case)

image::new-project-details.png[image]

- Click `Create`


*Step 2: Create an application that uses Dockerfile*

This time we will use a project that has a Dockerfile in a source code
repository. We will use a simple project on github
(https://github.com/VeerMuchandi/time). "rhel" folder from this github
project is built starting with rhel7 as the base image which is
described in Dockerfile. Look at the Dockerfile for this project. It
starts off with `registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7` image. It copies the
source code which is a simple `init.sh` file and exposes port `8080`.
Look at the `init.sh` that just displays the current datetime. There is
also a PHP version of the same project available in the php folder if
you like to use that. The php version does exactly the same it has a
`time.php` file that displays the time.

NOTE: When OpenShift finds a Dockerfile in the source, it uses
this Dockerfile as the basis to create a docker image for your
application. This strategy is called *Docker Build* strategy on
OpenShift. We'll see more about it when we look at the build
configuration a couple of steps down the line. Once OpenShift builds the
application's docker image, it stores that in a local docker registry.
Later it uses this image to deploy an application that runs in a pod.


Now let's create an application using this approach.

- Click `Add to Project` --> select `Browse Catalog` if you are using the same project from lab 1

image::browse-catalog.png[image]

- Type: dockerfile
- Click `Select` on the dockerfilebuild template

image::dockerfile-template.png[image]

- Enter values for Parameters as shown below:
  * Application Name: time
  * Git Repo: https://github.com/VeerMuchandi/time

- Click `Create` and `Continue to overview`

You'll notice that OpenShift created a few things at this point. You
will find a buildconfig, deploymentconfig, service and imagestreams in
the above list. The application is not running yet. It needs to be built
and deployed. Within a minute or so, you will see that OpenShift starts
the build.

*Step 3: Build*

In the meanwhile lets have a look at the buildconfig by running the
command shown below.

- Click `Overview` on the left menu

image::overview.png[image]

- Click Builds on the left menu --> select Builds
- Click onto `#1`
- Click on `Logs` to view the build logs
- Log shows as shown below
  ```
  Removing intermediate container 850026b88ed6
  Successfully built 86375f734d8f
  Pushing image docker-registry.default.svc:5000/workshop/time:latest
  Push successful
  ```

  Note the name of the build that is running i.e. time #1. We will use that
  name to look at the build logs. Run the command as shown below to look
  at the build logs. This will run for a few mins. At the end you will
  notice that the docker image is successfully created and it will start
  pushing this to OpenShift's internal docker registry.
  In the above log note how the image is pushed to the local docker
  registry. The registry is running at `docker-registry.default.svc:5000/`.

- Click `Builds` --> `Builds` on the left menu

image::build-menu.png[image]

- Click onto `time`
- Click `Actions` --> `Edit` on the top right to view the buildconfig
- Click `Actions` --> `Edit yaml` to view the buildconfig YAML file

image::edit.png[image]
- Click `Cancel`


  Note the name of the buildconfig in metadata is set to "time", the git
  uri pointing to the value you gave while creating the application. Also
  note the Strategy.type set to "Docker". This indicates that the build
  will use the instructions in this Dockerfile to do the docker build.


*Step 4: Deployment*

Once the image is pushed to the docker registry, OpenShift will trigger
a deploy process. Let us also quickly look at the deployment
configuration by running the following command. Note dc represents
deploymentconfig.

- Click `Applications` --> `Deployments` from the left menu
- Click `time`
- Click `Actions` --> `Edit YAML`

  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: DeploymentConfig
  metadata:
    annotations:
      openshift.io/generated-by: OpenShiftNewApp
    creationTimestamp: '2017-09-15T23:49:45Z'
    generation: 5
    labels:
      app: time
    name: time
    namespace: workshop
    resourceVersion: '142269'
    selfLink: /oapi/v1/namespaces/workshop/deploymentconfigs/time
    uid: 8d1a6b68-9a70-11e7-a153-080027ed01ae
  spec:
    replicas: 1
    selector:
      app: time
      deploymentconfig: time
    strategy:
      activeDeadlineSeconds: 21600
      resources: {}
      rollingParams:
        intervalSeconds: 1
        maxSurge: 25%
        maxUnavailable: 25%
        timeoutSeconds: 600
        updatePeriodSeconds: 1
      type: Rolling
    template:
      metadata:
        annotations:
          openshift.io/generated-by: OpenShiftNewApp
        creationTimestamp: null
        labels:
          app: time
          deploymentconfig: time
      spec:
        containers:
          - image: >-
              docker-registry.default.svc:5000/workshop/time@sha256:760db5000a9084382a8f31ffd40c6e45060819d414351fb990aee677482b1c5c
            imagePullPolicy: Always
            name: time
            ports:
              - containerPort: 8080
                protocol: TCP
            resources: {}
            terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
            terminationMessagePolicy: File
        dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
        restartPolicy: Always
        schedulerName: default-scheduler
        securityContext: {}
        terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
        ```

  Note where the image is picked from. It shows that the deployment picks
  the image from the local registry (same ip address and port as in
  buildconfig) and the image tag is same as what we built earlier. This
  means the deployment step deploys the application image what was built
  earlier during the build step.

- Click `Cancel`
- Click `Applications` --> `Pods`
  If you get the list of pods, you'll notice that the application gets
  deployed quickly and starts running in its own pod.


*Step 5: Adding route*

This step is very much the same as what we did in the previous exercise.
We will check the service and add a route to expose that service.

- Click `Applications` --> `Services`
- Click `Overview`
- Click `Create Route` to expose service as a route

image::create-route.png[image]

- Click `Create`
- Click `Applications` --> `Routes` to view the list of routes

*Step 6: Run the application*

- Click `Applications` --> `Routes`
- Click `time` route
- Click on link under the route name

Now run the application by using the route you provided in the previous
step. You can use either curl or your browser. The application displays
time. *If you don't provide time.php extension, it displays apache's
default index page.*


Congratulations!! In this exercise you have learnt how to create, build
and deploy an application using OpenShift's "Docker Build strategy".
