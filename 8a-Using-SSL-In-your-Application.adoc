Using SSL in your application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this exercise you will set up your application to encrypt traffic
with the OpenShift Wildcard certificate.

*Step 1: Switch to an existing project*

For this exercise, we will be using an already running application. We
will be using the `mycliproject-UserName` that you created in the
previous labs. Make sure you are switched to that project.

- login to web UI via {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}
- Use the same username and password that assigned to you
- Click anywhere onto `OPENSHIFT CONTAINER PLATFORM` on top left
- Click onto `mycliproject-UserName`

*Step 2: View the routing config*

- Click `Applications` --> select `Routes`
- Click `welcome`


*Step 3: TLS Edge Termination*

OpenShift has a _wildcard_ SSL certificate that it can use for any
application. We can use this SSL certificate to serve SSL from our
application without having to generate a cert of our own (which is
sometimes called SSL-offloading).

Edit your routing configuration:

- Click `Action` (top right) --> select `Edit`
- Checked the checkbox next to `Secure route`
- Click `Save`

*Step 4: Verify*

Verify by visiting your page by using the `https://` URI

Congratulations!! In this exercise you have learned about service SSL
from your application
