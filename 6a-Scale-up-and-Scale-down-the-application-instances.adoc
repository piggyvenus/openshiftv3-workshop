Scale up and Scale down and Idle the application instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this exercise we will learn how to scale our application. OpenShift
has the capability to scale your application and make sure that many
instances are always running.

*Step 1: Switch to an existing project*

For this exercise, we will be using an already running application. We
will be using the `mycliproject-UserName` that you created in the
previous labs. Make sure you are switched to that project.

- login to web UI via {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}
- Use the same username and password that assigned to you
- Click anywhere onto `OPENSHIFT CONTAINER PLATFORM` on top left
- Click onto `mycliproject-UserName`

*Step 2: View the deployment config*

- Click `welcome` under DEPLOYMENT CONFIG on 'Overview' page
- Click `Configuration` tab

Note that the `replicas:` is set to `1`. This tells OpenShift that when
this application deploys, make sure that there is 1 instance.

The `replicationController` mirrors this configuration initially; the
`replicationController` (or `rc`) will ensure that there is always the
set number of instances always running.

- To view number of pod running
- Click `Applications` --> select 'Pods'
- This shows all the pod running in the project


*Step 3: Scale Application*

To scale your application we will edit the `deploymentConfig` to 3.

Open your browser to the Overview page and note you only have one
instance running.

- Click onto the arrow up.

If you look at the web console and you will see that there are 3
instances running now

- Check the Pod by clicking `Applications` --> `Pods`


*Step 7: Scaling Down*

Scaling down is the same procedure as scaling up.

- On `Overview` page
- Click arrow down next to the blue circle

Congratulations!! In this exercise you have learned about scaling and
how to scale up/down your application on OpenShift!
