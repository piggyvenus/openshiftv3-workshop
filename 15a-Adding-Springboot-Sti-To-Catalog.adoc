Adding Spring Boot S2I Image to the Project Catalog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the last lab to deploy a spring boot application, we used the S2I image directly from a docker registry
that is outside OpenShift environment. The Spring Boot image was not in
the catalog. In this lab, we will learn how to add the Spring Boot image
to the project catalog so that you can deploy the application directly
from your screen.

*Step 1: Create a new project*

IMPORTANT: Please replace *userxx* with the username assigned to you in
the commands below.

IMPORTANT: Please replace *userxx* with your username

- login to web UI via https://master.ocp.tauil.org
- Use the same username and password that assigned to you
- Click `Create Project`

- Enter project name (all lower case) as spring-*userxx* and other information

image::new-project-details.png[image]

- Click `Create`

*Step 2:* Add the Spring Boot image stream.

- Open a browser and go to this location
https://github.com/VeerMuchandi/openshift-springboot/blob/master/springboot-imagestream.json
Please go through the contents of this file.

  {
      "kind": "ImageStream",
      "apiVersion": "v1",
      "metadata": {
          "name": "springboot"
      },
      "spec": {
          "tags": [
              {
                  "name": "latest",
                  "annotations": {
                      "description": "Spring Boot S2I Image CentOS based",
                      "iconClass": "icon-jboss",
                      "tags": "builder,springboot,java,maven",
                      "supports": "springboot,java:8,maven",
                      "version": "1.0"
                  },
              "from": {
                "kind": "DockerImage",
                "name": "docker.io/veermuchandi/spring-mvn-base:latest"
              }
              }
          ]
      }
  }
  ....

Notice, that this json points to the Spring Boot S2I builder Image on
docker hub. Also note the tags used in this imagestream. The tag
`builder` will display this in the catalog.

You have two ways to add this to the catalog.
1. Add from command line
2. Add using the web console

To add using Web UI

- Click `Add to Project` --> select `Import YAML/JSON`
- Copy the contents from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VeerMuchandi/openshift-springboot/master/springboot-imagestream.json into the text area
- Click `Create`
- Click `Builds` --> `Images` to validate your spring boot image if it is listed


*Step 3 - Create application*

Now it is time to create your application. Press on `Add to Project`
button on the web console. This will take you to `Browse Catalog`. You
will start seeing `springboot` listed in the catalog. If you have
trouble finding it, type _spring_ in the filter box, and you should find
it.

Now use that S2I image to deploy your sample spring boot application
https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app on OpenShift
using your experience from the previous labs.

Congratulations!! you have learnt to make an image stream available in
your project.

*If you got a question in mind* - _Well how can I make this image
available for everyone?_ Pat yourself on your back.. or ask your
colleague to do it ;). You are thinking right. All you need to do is
tell your openshift cluster administrator. +
*Answer* The cluster administrator will add the image to the `openshift`
project and everyone will start seeing it.
