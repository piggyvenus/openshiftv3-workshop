Binary Deployment of a war file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the past you have seen how OpenShift can take your existing java
code, build it and deploy the resultant docker image as an application.
OpenShift S2I process includes an assemble script that copies the source
code from a git repository, invokes a maven build, places the resultant
war file in the deployments folder, builds a new application image and
pushes that image into the registry.

But how about if you want OpenShift to deploy a war file that you built
yourself?

In this exercise you will learn to deploy a war file. We will assume
that you built your source code outside of OpenShift build process and
want to download the WAR file on your workstation.

*Step 1: Add a new project from command line*

IMPORTANT: Please replace *userxx* with your username

- login to web UI via https://master.ocp.tauil.org
- Use the same username and password that assigned to you
- Click `Create Project`

- Enter `dockerfile-*userxx*` as project name (all lower case)

- Click `Create`


*Step 2: Deploy war file on Tomcat and containerized it via S2I*

- Click `Add to Project`
- Click `Java`
- Click `Red Hat JBoss Web Server (Tomcat)`
- Click select under `Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3.0 Tomcat 8`
- Enter name as `petstore`
- Enter Git repository URL as `https://github.com/VeerMuchandi/ews-bin-deploy.git`
- Click show `advance options`
- Add environment variable under `Build Configuration` as below
WAR_FILE_URL and https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VeerMuchandi/ps/master/deployments/ROOT.war
- Scroll down and click `Create`
- Click `Continue to Overview`


*Step 3: Customized build configuration for S2I*

In the Git repo example https://github.com/VeerMuchandi/ews-bin-deploy, the build assemble script was modified to take an binary file.
In the custom assemble script (https://github.com/VeerMuchandi/ews-bin-deploy/blob/master/.sti/bin/assemble) we passed an environment variable. But we did not assign any value to that yet. We need to tell our build configuration on which .war file to use to deploy. Now we will edit the build configuration to add an environment variable WAR_FILE_URL that points to where your .war file is. Your build management tool may have placed your .war file in an artifact repository and you can point to that. In this example, we are using the petstore war file that I posted on github.

Note: OpenShift does an automatic build and deploy within minutes after your application is created. So by the time you are here, a build may have already started. Don’t worry. There is no harm. Let it go. We will start a build again after we edited the build configuration.

Since we are using the template from the OpenShift catalog, it will create service and route for the application.


You can use the route to access the application using the URL.
